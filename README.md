# webIntro
summer 2017 web intern in China telecon

The websites are attempts to learn the combinition of the front-end and back-end development. I use html5, bootstrap and jQuery for the front-end, mySql and php for the back-end, ajax for transmittion. The websites consist of a login system and a dairy part for users to write down their thoughts to me. 

There are many many improvements can be done to the websites. For example, I did not use cookies to keep the user stauts because I met a challenge regarding the time concept of cookies in order to delete it;Instead, I use session concept to replace cookies. Besides, I should keep a good styling next time by separating php, html and css files. At last, the developer in the company said to me that md5 as a encrypting method is not safe so there is potential safety problems in the website. 

Regardless the problems this website has, it is functional and has many features that I tried hard to learn and blend in with the website.
